    // Then I insert that data into the databases

    // And that should be it?

    // So basically Init Data

    // The MYSQL in InitData needs to Set the different options in the warehouse table

    // -> Then It puts in the Products Seperately

    // -> And finally it adds all possible connections in the ManyToMany table

    // -> We Need to get the warehouse- and productids and insert the values into the many to many
